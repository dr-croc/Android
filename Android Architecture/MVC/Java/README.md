Full meaning of MVC : 
Model View Controller
1. Model -> mvc_model.java -> where we are getting the data base from
2. View -> TextView -> for showing the data
3. Controller -> MainActivity.java -> button request from the activity for the data

so again ->
1. Model : Model is nothing but data
2. View : ui design
3. Controller : Control all the task/event that a user perform

Flow of work ->__
VIEW -> CONTROLLER -> MODEL(get the data) -> again to CONTROLLER-> VIEW


For better understanding : 
Suppose you went to a resturant for drinking a bottle of water, 
so you went there, 
1. you opended the fridge
2. you get the water bottle 
3. you pay 

So here -> 
1. Model -> Bottle 
2. View -> You
3. Controller -> You

same like above example, you request data from your api/database,  for showing the data you create a text view and for resutl you used button from main activity
